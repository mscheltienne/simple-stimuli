        "\n# Colored noise\n\nA noise signal is produced by a stochastic process. The color of noise, also\ncalled the noise spectrum, refers to the power spectrum of a noise signal.\n\nThe practice of naming kinds of noise after colors started with white noise,\na signal whose spectrum has equal power within any equal interval of\nfrequencies. That name was given by analogy with white light, which was\n(incorrectly) assumed to have such a flat power spectrum over the visible\nrange. Other color names, such as ``pink``, ``red``, and ``blue`` were then\ngiven to noise with other spectral profiles, often (but not always) in\nreference to the color of light with similar spectra. Some of those names\nhave standard definitions in certain disciplines, while others are very\ninformal and poorly defined.\n\nSource: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colors_of_noise)\n"
